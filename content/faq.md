These frequently asked questions provide more information about how we make suits. 

<br/>

## 1. WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE ORDER?

<br/>

Make sure you have the correct tracking number. If you do, orders may simply be delayed due to customs, needing to order more fabric, or any other of a multitude of reasons. You may contact us to help you resolve this issue, but we normally send an email notification of any delays.

<br/>

## 2. WHAT ARE THE POSTAL RATES?

<br/>

The postal rates vary by country. We will inform you of the shipping costs when you are choosing your suit.

* USA = $20
* RUS = $20
* Singapore = $20
* etc etc etc

<br/>

## 3. DO YOU SEND OVERSEAS?

<br/>

We do send overseas! When you choose your suit, our tailors will tell you approximately how much your suit would cost to ship to your country.

<br/>

## 4. WHY ARE YOU LESS EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS?

<br/>

Our method eliminates the need for any alterations, which takes more time and money. In fact, we are so confident that you will not have to have your suit altered that we will refund you $100 of the cost of your suit if you do! Just send us the reciept from where you altered your suit, and we will refund you the $100 credit.
