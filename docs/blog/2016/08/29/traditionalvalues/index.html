<h1 id="chivalry-is-not-dead-proof-today-s-guys-can-be-perfect-gents">Chivalry is not dead &hellip; proof today’s guys can be perfect gents</h1>

<p>A MODERN gentleman still displays the good manners of his forebears, according to a study.</p>

<p>He is as respectful, polite and kind as any chivalrous knight of old, as he holds the door open for others, pays attention when people speak and always keeps his shoes nice and shiny.</p>

<p>The 21st-century code of etiquette also includes putting his mobile phone away at the dinner table, keeping fit and wearing a good suit.</p>

<p>A quarter of Britons also think any well-mannered chap would be able to cook a decent meal (28 per cent) and keep their house tidy (33 per cent).</p>

<p>In a rejection of House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, who has decreed men no longer need to wear a tie in Parliament, modern gentleman sport a well-tailored suit and tie (58 per cent) and smart, short haircut (41 per cent).</p>

<p>Long hair, a top-knot or a quiff are considered “ungentlemanly”.</p>

<p>Dressing down is not favoured by 63 per cent of men who want to wear a formal suit when they have to present themselves at their best, and are willing to pay a typical £600 to guarantee a positive first impression.</p>

<p>Women apparently think the same, with 44 per cent saying a man is most attractive wearing a fine suit and 42 per cent thinking it a more professional image. Sotos Georgalli of Moss Bros, the men’s tailors who commissioned the poll, said: “We have seen a rise in dressed-down recently but most men still find it challenging to make a great impression in casual clothing.</p>

<p>“If anything, the trend towards sportswear worn as an everyday uniform has helped to elevate the status of the tailored suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“From movie stars to entrepreneurs, wearing a fantastic suit remains a sartorial byword for ambition and success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“It comes as little surprise then that more than a third of British men feel most professional and powerful in a tailored suit, while almost half feel their smartest when dressed in their best.”</p>

<p>While a stylish appearance goes hand-in-hand with being gentlemanly, it is not the most important trait.</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde defined a gentleman as someone “who never hurts anyone’s feelings unintentionally”.</p>

<p>George Bernard Shaw said a gentleman always “puts more into the world than he takes out”. Puts his phone away at dinner.</p>
