      <description>Chivalry is not dead &amp;hellip; proof todayâ€™s guys can be perfect gents A MODERN gentleman still displays the good manners of his forebears, according to a study.
He is as respectful, polite and kind as any chivalrous knight of old, as he holds the door open for others, pays attention when people speak and always keeps his shoes nice and shiny.
The 21st-century code of etiquette also includes putting his mobile phone away at the dinner table, keeping fit and wearing a good suit.</description>

      <description>Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what kind of suit you&amp;rsquo;re investing in, whether it&amp;rsquo;s $200 or $2,000, flannel or seersucker, two-button or three. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen plenty of guys who&amp;rsquo;ve bought the right suit and let it hang off them like an NBA rookie on draft night. And we&amp;rsquo;ve seen men in cheap but well-tailored suits who look like a million bucks. The thing&amp;rsquo;s got to fit right, or else there&amp;rsquo;s no point in wearing it.</description>
